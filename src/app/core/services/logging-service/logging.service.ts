// FJ Notes / TODO:
// 1 - "services" folder isn't the greatest place for this - can be abstracted out when we look at folder structure.
// 2 - I've abstracted out the Raven code into a separate service as:
//   a) It's got a few things missing (in the type definitions) that are better abstracted out
//   b) It's possible we may go with another logging provider
// 3 - This should probably be part of the main shared component library, but unsure of the workflow with that.  Again we can abstract out later.
// 4 - The config should be installed via a separate config file, which we'll be looking at later ...
// 5 - It is not anticipated this is the finished article, more will be added over time ...
// 6 - Add e2e tests and check the isSetup and getLastEventID methods to verify the report has been made.
//   - see the following for example scenarios - https://github.com/toepoke/raven-webpack/blob/master/src/app/app.component.ts
